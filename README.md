## [NeurIPS 2022] Periodic Signal Recovery with Regularized Sine-NN

By **David A. R. Robin, Kevin Scaman, Marc Lelarge**

Code for the experiments and plot of figures 1 through 7.
See [[robindar.com]](https://www.robindar.com/#neurips-22-periodic) for up-to-date information and links related to the paper.
Use `make all` to reproduce all figures (to `images/` directory), or see Makefile for more control over which figures to reproduce.
Use the environment variable `MAX_ITER` to limit the number of iterations when checking that the code works as expected (e.g. `MAX_ITER=100 make all`).
